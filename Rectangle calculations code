#This program calculates the area of a rectangle with given values, and asks you to calculate the answer to find if your solution was correct or incorrect

print('Today we are going to calculate the area of a rectangle in cm2 with your inputs.')
h = (int(input('Enter the height of the rectangle:')))
w = (int(input('Enter the width of the rectangle:')))
a = (int(input('Enter your guess for the area of the rectangle:')))
b = h * w 

if a < b:

  print("That was incorrect, the answer is: %d" %(b))

if a > b:

  print("That was incorrect, the answer is: %d" %(b))

if a == b:

  print("You were correct! The answer is: %d" %(b))
